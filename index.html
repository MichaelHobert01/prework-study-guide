        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) => A high level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more. JS is a very critical tool. </li>
          <li>Array =>  A single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way. Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types. The array that we will add to our project only contains strings.</li>
          <li>Variable => Containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable. “Var” is how to declare one. Once you give it a title it has to be camelCase</li>
          <li>For Loop => Uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
