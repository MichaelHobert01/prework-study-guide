## Description

I really needed a refresher on the big 3 of the frontend, and this study guide helped a lot. I was also not super familar with Git Bash, and this helped tremendously. Codeacademy is not anywhere as helpful as this was in learning to use Git. I built the webpage to help me study the concepts, I also made a google docs with notes on every topic but the webpage was helpful because it was an actual expierence. Before it I had no idea how much of a role Git Bash, Github and a coding enviorment plays in. We started with HTML and I had almost no difficulty with it because I studied it before. CSS is something I'm going to be studying alot prior to the initial date of bootcamp. CSS covered here wasn't hard though, it was all stuff I knew prior. The same can be said with Javascript. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You can see that I have typed about different programming content using HTML. The CSS just provides some appealing blue-white contrast. And the JS can be accessed by using the console. It will randomly tell you to study a topic depending on the Math.random object incorporated into a function.

## Tests

There wasn't much to test. For the Math.random part of the function I refreshed the page to make sure it was working.
